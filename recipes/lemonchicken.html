        <img src="lemonchicken.webp" height="300" width="300">
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Cheese: Of course, you’ll need Parmesan cheese (freshly grated is best). You’ll also need mascarpone (or cream cheese) for the rich sauce.</p>
            <p>Flour: Dredge the chicken in all-purpose flour before you brown it for the crispiest results.</p>
            <p>Chicken: Eight boneless skinless chicken thighs will make four servings.</p>
            <p>Seasonings: Simply season the chicken with salt and black pepper.</p>
            <p>Oil: Brown the chicken in olive oil.</p>
            <p>Garlic: Three cloves of garlic add bold flavor.</p>
            <p>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth. </p>
            <p>Lemon: This creamy chicken recipe uses every part of the lemon, from the zest to the juice. You’ll also garnish each serving with lemon wedges.</p>
            <p>Cornstarch: Make a slurry with cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.</p>
            <p>Herbs: Garnish each serving with fresh basil or oregano for a pleasant pop of color.</p>
